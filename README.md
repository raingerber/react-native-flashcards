# Mobile Flashcards Project in React Native

Use these terminal commands to get the project running:

* `npm install`

* `npm start`

## NOTES

* This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

* There is no form validation, so empty input will be accepted

* Pressing a deck button in the main list will generate an animation where the button becomes semi-transparent

* This app was tested with Expo on an iPhone and a Samsung Galaxy S5. It was not tested in the simulators.

* The deck view page does not show the "Start a Quiz" button until at least one question has been added

* Notifications telling the user will occur at 8:00 daily unless the user completes at least one quiz for that day
